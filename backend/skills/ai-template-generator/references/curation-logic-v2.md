# Curation Logic and Discovery Principles (Enhanced v2)

## Purpose

This document defines the logical framework AI should follow when discovering new curation opportunities and generating observation/guidance pairs. **Enhanced with market analysis frameworks and business logic evaluation.**

## Core Principles

### 1. Value-Driven Discovery

Every curation template must provide **clear value** to at least one user persona:

- **Solo Indie Hacker**: Actionable, low-barrier opportunities
- **First-Time Founder**: Risk-reduction, validation patterns
- **Serial Entrepreneur**: Non-obvious insights, market gaps
- **Product Manager**: Competitive intelligence, success patterns

### 2. Data-Driven Insights

Templates should be based on **actual patterns** in the data, not hypothetical scenarios:

- Minimum 3-5 products should match the filters
- Patterns should be statistically significant
- Avoid over-fitting to outliers

### 3. Contrast and Surprise

The most valuable templates create **"aha moments"** by revealing:

- Counter-intuitive patterns (low X + high Y)
- Hidden opportunities (underserved niches)
- Success factors (what actually works)
- Risk mitigation (what to avoid)

### 4. Market-Driven Analysis (NEW)

Templates should incorporate **market and business perspectives**:

- Market opportunity assessment (TAM/SAM/SOM)
- Competitive landscape analysis (Five Forces)
- Value proposition clarity (Value Theory)
- Business model viability (Unit Economics)

## Enhanced Discovery Process

### Step 0: Market Context Analysis (NEW)

Before diving into product patterns, understand the **market landscape**:

**Market Opportunity:**
- What's the market size? (Small/Medium/Large)
- Is it growing or declining?
- What's the competitive intensity?

**User Value:**
- How acute is the pain point?
- How clear is the value proposition?
- Can users quantify ROI?

**Business Viability:**
- Are unit economics favorable?
- What's the retention expectation?
- Is the pricing strategy sound?

### Step 1: Analyze Mother Theme Distributions

Look for **imbalances and clusters** in mother theme data:

```
Example patterns to discover:
- Many "产品驱动" but few "IP驱动" → Opportunity for product-first strategies
- High "真实机会" + "主动搜索型" → Validated demand patterns
- "非常适合" solo + "低门槛" → Weekend project opportunities
```

**NEW: Apply Market Frameworks:**
- Use **Porter's Five Forces** to assess competitive intensity
- Use **Blue Ocean Strategy** to identify differentiation opportunities
- Use **Value Theory** to evaluate pricing potential

### Step 2: Find Interesting Combinations

Identify **multi-dimensional patterns** that create contrast:

**Original Patterns (1-4):**

### Step 3: Validate Product Count

Check if the pattern matches enough products:

```python
Ideal range: 5-15 products
Minimum: 3 products
Maximum: 30 products (too broad)
```

### Step 4: Extract Insight with Market Context (ENHANCED)

Formulate the **actionable takeaway** with market perspective:

**Product Insight:**
