# Market Analysis Frameworks

This reference provides detailed guidance on applying market analysis frameworks to discover and evaluate curation opportunities.

## Porter's Five Forces

Analyze industry attractiveness and competitive intensity to identify strategic opportunities.

### Force 1: Threat of New Entrants

**What to Look For:**
- Low barriers to entry = High threat = Crowded market
- High barriers = Low threat = Opportunity for defensibility

**Barriers to Entry:**
- Capital requirements (funding needed)
- Economies of scale (cost advantages at scale)
- Switching costs (hard to leave once adopted)
- Brand loyalty (established trust)
- Regulatory barriers (licenses, compliance)
- Network effects (value increases with users)

**Curation Opportunities:**
- **High Barriers**: Products with strong moats (network effects, data advantages)
- **Low Barriers**: Fast-moving markets where speed wins

**Example:**
"Products with built-in network effects" - High barrier to entry once established

### Force 2: Bargaining Power of Suppliers

**What to Look For:**
- Few critical suppliers = High power = Risk
- Many alternatives = Low power = Opportunity

**Supplier Power Factors:**
- Supplier concentration
- Availability of substitutes
- Importance to supplier
- Forward integration threat

**Curation Opportunities:**
- Products that reduce supplier dependency
- Tools that aggregate multiple suppliers
- Platforms that create new supply

**Example:**
"Tools that eliminate expensive third-party dependencies"

### Force 3: Bargaining Power of Buyers

**What to Look For:**
- Few large customers = High power = Pricing pressure
- Many small customers = Low power = Pricing freedom

**Buyer Power Factors:**
- Customer concentration
- Volume purchased
- Product differentiation
- Price sensitivity

**Curation Opportunities:**
- Products serving fragmented markets (many small buyers)
- High differentiation reducing buyer power
- Lock-in mechanisms increasing switching costs

**Example:**
"SMB-focused tools with low customer concentration risk"

### Force 4: Threat of Substitutes

**What to Look For:**
- Many alternatives = High threat = Must differentiate
- Few alternatives = Low threat = Pricing power

**Substitute Considerations:**
- Alternative solutions (different approaches)
- Price-performance tradeoff
- Switching costs
- Buyer propensity to substitute

**Curation Opportunities:**
- Products solving problems with no good alternatives
- Solutions with high switching costs
- Unique approaches to common problems

**Example:**
"Tools solving problems that previously had no software solution"

### Force 5: Competitive Rivalry

2. Rate each competitor on each factor (Y-axis: Low to High)
3. Plot your product's profile
4. Identify gaps and opportunities

**Curation Angles:**
- Products with unique strategy canvas profiles
- Tools that excel where competitors are weak
- Solutions that eliminate/reduce/raise/create differently

### Value Innovation

The cornerstone of blue ocean strategy: Pursue differentiation AND low cost simultaneously.

**Traditional Thinking**: Differentiation OR low cost (trade-off)
**Blue Ocean Thinking**: Differentiation AND low cost (value innovation)

**Curation Opportunities:**
- Products offering premium features at budget prices
- Tools that reduce costs while adding value
- Solutions that break the value-cost trade-off

**Example:**
"Enterprise-grade tools at indie hacker prices"
